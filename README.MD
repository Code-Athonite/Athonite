# Athonite

I have always loved reading, and about a year ago, I stumbled upon a genre of books that profoundly transformed my life in such a short period of time. This project is my way of honoring the authors whose work has left such a lasting impact. Although it's still a work in progress, Iâ€™ve included some design mockups to offer a glimpse.
